# Welcome to PUNoted-API!

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **PUNoted-API** project. We appreciate your help and look forward to your contributions. To ensure a smooth and legally sound development process for everyone, we require all contributors to agree to our Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

We use an automated process to manage our CLA. By signing the CLA, you grant us an irrevocable license to use your contributions, which protects both you and the project from legal issues. It also ensures the long-term sustainability and integrity of our codebase.

**How to Sign the CLA:**

* When you open your first pull request, a bot from **CLA-assistant.io** will automatically post a comment on it.
* This comment will contain a link to a secure page where you can read and sign the CLA electronically.
* The signing process is a one-time step. Once you've signed, the bot will remember you for all future contributions to this project.

### Instructions for Copyright Non-Owners

If you do not own the full copyright to your contribution (for example, if you are contributing code written for your employer), please have your legal department contact the project owner directly at xflasar@gmail.com to discuss a different type of contributor agreement.
